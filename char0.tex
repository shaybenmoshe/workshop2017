\section{Characteristic $0$}

\begin{theorem*}
	A formal group law over a $\mbb{Q}$-algebra has a logarithm.
\end{theorem*}

\begin{proof}
	Let $F$ be such a formal group law, and denote $F_2 = \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$.
	Since $F\left(x,y\right) = x+y+\cdots$, we know that $F_2\left(0,0\right) = 1$, thus $F_2\left(t,0\right)$ is (multiplicatively) invertible.
	Since each $0 \neq n \in \mathbb{Z}$ is invertible, we can define the following:
	$$ f\left(x\right) = \int_0^x \frac{\dd{t}}{F_2\left(t,0\right)} $$
	We claim that it is a logarithm.
	We know that $f\left(0\right) = 0$ and $f'\left(0\right) = \frac{1}{F_2\left(0,0\right)} = 1$.
	It is sufficient to prove that
	$
		w\left(x,y\right)
		= f\left(F\left(x,y\right)\right) - f\left(x\right) - f\left(y\right)
		= \sum c_{ij} x^i y^j
	$
	vanishes.
	First, note that
	$
		w\left(x,0\right)
		= f\left(F\left(x,0\right)\right) - f\left(x\right) - f\left(0\right)
		= f\left(x\right) - f\left(x\right) - 0
		= 0
	$
	and it follows that $c_{i0} = 0$.
	If we prove that
	\begin{align*}
		0
		&= \frac{\partial w}{\partial y}\\
		&= f'\left(F\left(x,y\right)\right) F_2\left(x,y\right) - f'\left(y\right)\\
		&= \frac{1}{F_2\left(F\left(x,y\right),0\right)} F_2\left(x,y\right) - \frac{1}{F_2\left(y,0\right)}
	\end{align*}
	it follows that $j c_{ij} = 0$, and since each $0 \neq j \in \mathbb{Z}$ is invertible, $c_{ij} = 0, j > 0$, which finishes the proof.
	Indeed, by associativity,
	$F\left(F\left(x,y\right),z\right)=F\left(x,F\left(y,z\right)\right)$, differentiating w.r.t. $z$ at $z=0$ we get,
	$
		F_2\left(F\left(x,y\right),0\right)
		= F_2\left(x,y\right) F_2\left(y,0\right)
	$
	and the result follows.
